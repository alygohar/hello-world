# hello-world
This is my first repository 

Hello Github, my name is Aly Gohar
I'm pretty much completely new to programming but I hope that in due time I will gather enough experience to integrate programming into my professional career as a digital marketer. I am a big fan of the digital age and I strongly believe that a solid understanding of web technologies is an essential trait of any successful digital marketer.
